## (Development mode)

it is still in development, 1 main thing that is still not working correctly is the Touch on item and drag.
this need to been rebuilded, all items can been dragged and dropped from all type of size and location.

i leave this so as it is, later will come back to this. my head can not handle this at this moment.
