## (Development mode)

# Goal:
- learn reading large code
- update the code
- change from java to kotlin the code

I get the code from github and change the code to my needs, learn to read someone else his code.
than after he worked smooth i did change the code from java to kotlin. (this cause some issues)


Now i get to build some Website + App + Data System for a start-up company,
when i am done with this and get some time over  i will come back to this project.

# current issues still need to be fixed
- drag and drop from items is not working (correctly)
- clean the code from desktop
